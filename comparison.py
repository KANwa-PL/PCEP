# Using one of the comparison operators in Python, write a simple two-line program that takes the parameter n as input,
# which is an integer, and prints False if n is less than 100, and True if n is greater than or equal to 100.

n = int(input("Check this number: "))

result = "True" if n >= 100 else "False"

print(result)
